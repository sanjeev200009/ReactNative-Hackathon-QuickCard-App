# ReactNative-Hackathon-QuickCard-App
This repository contains the backend API for my QuickCart app, developed for a hackathon. The API handles all backend functionalities, including authentication, product management, and order processing.

This project serves as a learning experience to understand backend development before implementing a full-scale solution for real-world issues in Sri Lanka.

⚠️ Note: This repository contains only the backend API. The mobile app is located in a separate repository.
